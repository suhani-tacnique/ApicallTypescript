You are working on a fan website for Harry Potter enthusiasts. You have been given a task to create a functionality that lists Quidditch players from the Hogwarts houses.

In the TypeScript file, you have a program that performs a GET request on the route https://coderbyte.com/api/challenges/json/quidditch-list that returns a list of Harry Potter characters with their details in JSON format. From this list, you should filter only those characters who played Quidditch along with their houses and position, and print the final array as a JSON string.

Example Input:

[ { "name": "Percy Weasley", "house": "Gryffindor", "playsQuidditch": false, "position": "", "quidditchYears": [] }, 
{ "name": "Angelina Johnson", "house": "Gryffindor", "playsQuidditch": true, "position": "Chaser", "quidditchYears": [1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1995, 1996] } ]

Example Output:

["Angelina Johnson Gryffindor Chaser"]
